# Test data

`testdata/kiln-v2-cases.json` holds the 46 Kiln wire v2 cases. Each accept case is decoded and encoded again. The bytes must match the hex in the case. Each reject case must raise the recorded error name: `FRAME`, `LIMIT`, `EOF`, `TYPE`, `UTF8`, `TRAILING`, or `SCHEMA`.

`testdata/reference/kiln_ref.py` is a test oracle for Frozen scalars and structs. The runtime codec does not import it.

`testdata/schema/point.json` and `testdata/schema/message.json` are the JSON Schema files the generator reads. `scripts/check-generated.sh` runs the generator twice and diffs the output.

The wire rules those cases pin are written in the [Kiln wire v2](https://leo-gan.github.io/gld-kiln/spec/) specification.
